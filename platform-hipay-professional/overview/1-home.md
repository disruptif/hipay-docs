#About this Guide 

##Purpose
This document is designed to provide you details on how to integrate your business to the HiPay TPP payment gateway. This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to simply and quickly get up and running with our services as well as detailed reference material. Where applicable, this document refers to the related documentation with further details. 

##Intended Audience 
The intended audience is the merchant's technical staff or the merchant's system integrator. Because almost all communication between the merchant's system and the SOAP API is realized through predefined XML messages over the Internet using standard protocols, you will need basic XML/SOAP programming skills and knowledge of HTTP(S).

#API Overview

The API is based on SOAP principles; thus it is very easy to write and test applications.
How to access the API:

- Use your browser to access URLs,.
- Use almost any HTTP client in any programming language, to interact with the API.

##Security Considerations
HiPay Professional SOAP API service is protected to:

- ensure that only authorized Merchants use it,
- prevent payment information from being compromised

###Encrypted Communication

| Description   |      Guarantee of transcription    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| HiPay provides all SOAP API methods over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). |  This guarantees that all data transmitted between HiPay and the Merchant system is encrypted (256-bit encryption using a DigiCert certificate).

#Integration Guidelines
This chapter outlines the basic integration requirements that you app must meet.

##Submitting a Request

###Service Endpoints
There are two endpoints (base URLs) that you can make your API calls to.

- Stage if you are testing your integration, and
- Production for when you have finished testing and want your application to go live.
All URLs referenced in this guide must have one of the following bases:

| Environment   |      Endpoint    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| **Stage** |  [https://test-ws.hipay.com/](https://test-ws.hipay.com/)
| **Production** |  [https://ws.hipay.com/](https://ws.hipay.com/)

###Authentication

*Table 5: Service endpoints*

| Overview   |      Authentication    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| All requests to HiPay SOAP REST API require the Merchant to authenticate himself at each request. |  Your API credentials can be found in the Merchant Interface under Sell with Hipay -> Hipay integration -> Merchant Tool Kit / API -> Webservice Access.

###Character Encoding
All parameters accept UTF-8 encoded text via the API. All other encodings must be
converted to UTF-8 before sending them to the HiPay API in order to guarantee that the
data is not corrupted.

##Response Handling
Whether a request succeeded or not, it is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status
code indicates a success, whereas a 5xx status code indicates a failure.

###Response Status Codes
The HiPay API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.
These are the HTTP status codes you may receive and their meaning.

*Table 6: HTTP status codes*

| HTTP Status   |      Description    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| 200 OK |  The request was understood and is processing.
| 404 Not Found |  The resource requested does not exist.
| 500 Server Error |  The request has an error, mandatory parameters are missing or you are trying to send unknown parameters to the resource.
| 503 Service Unavailable |  HiPay API is temporarily unable to process the request. Try again later.

###Response Format
The HiPay API will respond to your request in SOAP XML format.
By default, HiPay SOAP API returns XML in a SOAP Envelope.
For example, here is the default XML representation of a “generate” result.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAPENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
xmlns:ns1="https://ws.hipay.com/soap/payment-v2">
	<SOAP-ENV:Body>
		<ns1:generateResponse>
			<generateResult>
				<redirectUrl>https://payment.hipay.com/index/pay/payid/716…7106fc</redirectUrl>
				<code>0</code>
				<description>N/A</description>
			</generateResult>
		</ns1:generateResponse>
	</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

##Error Handling
**Overview:** HiPay API returns one level of error information: a response body with additional details that can help you determine how to handle the exception.

**Exception properties** An exception has up to three properties.

| Property   |      Description    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| code |  0 = OK / >0 = Error.
| description |  A descriptive message regarding the exception.

*Table 7: Properties of an error message*

i.g. if you receive an exception with status code 400 (Bad Request), the and   properties are useful for debugging what went wrong.

**XML Error Example**

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP- ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="https://ws.hipay.com/soap/payment-v2">
	<SOAP-ENV:Body>
		<ns1:generateResponse>
			<generateResult>
				<redirectUrl/>
				<code>1</code>
				<description>Bad password for login '4f8x3x80fd4x476f1e227c68xefdx0x5'</description>
			</generateResult>
		</ns1:generateResponse>
	</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

#Server-to-Server Notifications
##What is a Server-to-Server Notification?
**Description**: In order to notify events related to your payment system, such as a new transaction or a 3-D Secure transaction, our platform can send to your application a Server-to-Server notification.

##Setup
To set your Notification URL you must set it on "urlCallback" parameter at the moment of generate a new order (please refer to Chapter 3.1 Request a New Order).
After a successful purchase, HiPay calls twice your Notification URL in background with comprehensive information about the payment passed through an HTTP POST parameter in an XML array `POST['xml']` the first time for the authorization notification and the second one for the capture notification.

| Operation Type   |      Description    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| authorization |  Authorization from the customer’s bank to make the capture.
| capture |  Notification of the real capture to debit the customer’s account.
| cancellation |  Previously-authorized transaction was cancelled.
| refund |  Previously-captured transaction was refunded.
| reject |  Charge Back. The cardholder reversed a capture processed by their bank or credit card company. For instance, the cardholder contacts his credit card company and denies having made the transaction. The credit card company then revokes the already captured payment. Please note the legal difference between shopper who ordered the goods and cardholder who owns the credit card and ends up paying for the order.<br/>In general charge backs only occur incidentally. When they do, contacting the shopper can often solve the situation. Occasionally it is an indication of credit card fraud.
*Table 8: Types of possible actions (represented by the value of operation variable)*

| Operation Type   |      Description    |
|----------|:-------------:|
| ok |  Operation succeeded.
| nok |  Operation not succeeded.
| cancel |  Cancelation of the operation.
| waiting |  Operation waiting for an action.

#Signature verification

##Introduction
It is strongly recommended to use a signature mechanism to verify the contents of a request or redirection made to your servers.

This prevents customers from tampering with the data in the data exchanges between your servers and our payment system.
A unique signature is sent each time that HiPay contact a merchant URL.

##Verification
For the URL notification, the signature is sent on the "md5content" parameter, to verify it, you just need so concatenate your "wsPassword" with the "result" part of the XML posted to you.

**Algorithm**:`Md5 Signature = md5('<result>...</result>' + wsPassword)`
